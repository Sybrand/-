# There's no place like ~

I'm so sick of re-creating a happy bash environment every time I move to a new computer! Next time, I'm tapping me feet, cloning git, and going ~.

## Installing

You need to drop this into ~ ; the easiest way (I think) to do that is as follow:

    cd ~
    git init .
    git remote add origin git@github.com:Sybrand/-.git
    git pull origin master
